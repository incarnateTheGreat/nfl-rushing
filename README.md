## Using the Tool

This program renders a list of NFL Players with a large amount of data. The user can navigate and collect the data by doing the following:

1) sorting Ascending/Descending via three fields -- Total Rushing Yards (Yds), Longest Rush (Lng), and Total Rushing Touchdowns (TD),
2) searching for a Player in the list by using the Textbox,
3) using Pagination to shorten the size of the list,
4) and export a CSV file when they have collected and sorted through the data that they want.
